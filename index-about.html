      <p class="para18">
        <br> <br>
        Dear beloved.
          <br> <br><br>
  We are writing to introduce you to Apostle Cliphine Nelson, a
   visionary leader and founder of Shalom Divine Ministries. As
    a man of God, Apostle Nelson has been called by the Lord to
     proclaim the good news of salvation, healing, prophecy, and
      God's word to a world in need.
  <br><br>
  Under the guidance of the Holy Spirit, Apostle Nelson has 
  founded Shalom Divine Ministries in June 1996, a ministry
   that is dedicated to fulfilling God's vision and mission.
    Through his teachings, sermons, and personal encounters 
    with God, Apostle Nelson has been empowered by the Lord to
     impart divine wisdom, healing, and guidance to those who
      seek Him.
  <br><br>
  As a prophet of God, Apostle Nelson has been given the gift
   of prophecy, allowing him to speak words of encouragement,
    comfort, and direction from the heart of God. His prophecies
     are not limited to specific individuals or groups but rather
      encompass entire nations and communities. He has been known
       to receive revelations from God that bring hope, restoration, and redemption to those who are seeking a deeper connection with the Lord.
  <br> <br>
  Apostle Nelson's ministry is not just about preaching the word
   of God; it is about demonstrating the power of God's presence 
   in every aspect of life. He has been blessed by the Lord to
    heal the sick, deliver the oppressed, and set captives free
    . His ministry is characterized by miracles, signs, and
     wonders that testify to the greatness and majesty of God.
  <br><br>
  Shalom Divine Ministries is a place where people can come
   to encounter God's love, mercy, and forgiveness. It is a
    place where individuals can find restoration, renewal, 
    and redemption in their lives. Through his teachings and
     personal interactions, Apostle Nelson has been instrumental
      in helping people discover their purpose and calling in
       life.
  <br><br>
  As a minister of God's word, Apostle Nelson has been called to
   fulfill a specific mission given by the Lord. His mission is 
   to take the gospel of Jesus Christ to every corner of the 
   earth, preaching the good news of salvation and demonstrating
    the power of God's presence. He has been blessed by the Lord
     to travel extensively, preaching in churches, conferences,
      and crusades around the world and he is also a good given.
  <br><br>
  We are honored to introduce you to Apostle Cliphine Nelson and
   Shalom Divine Ministries. We believe that you will be blessed
    by his teachings and ministry and he has many books written 
    by him . If you are seeking a deeper connection with God or 
    if you are looking for a place where you can grow spiritually,
     I encourage you to visit Shalom Divine Ministries or attend
     one of his conferences.
  <br><br>
  Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions or if
   you would like more information about Apostle Nelson's
    ministry.
  <br><br>
  May God bless you richly as you seek Him.
  <br><br><br>
  Sincerely,
  Church Board </p>
